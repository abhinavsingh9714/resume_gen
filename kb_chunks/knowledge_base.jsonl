Here are some easy to implement ideas to create a top-notch bullet resume."}
{"content": "Tips for Writing Good Resume Bullet Points\nStart each bullet point off with a resume action word for extra impact.\nLink experience and skills with accomplishments. Don\u2019t just write a laundry list of your abilities, use your resume bullet points to prove that you have the potential to be a productive employee.\nQuantify your achievements with numbers. Measurable results and metrics make for strong bullet points.\nUse active voice and simple language when writing each resume bullet. \nUse sentence fragments rather than whole sentences. E.g. \u201cGenerated $500k in profits to increase revenue by 30%.\u201d\nDon\u2019t save the best for last. Start your bullet point list with the most impressive/relevant skill, experience or accomplishment.\nBe consistent with your formatting. Circles, squares and diamonds all make effective bullet symbols, but stick to the same resume style throughout.\nStay relevant and don\u2019t be generic. Aim for a targeted resume by ensuring the information in your bullet points focuses on how you fulfil the key requirements for the job. \nBullet Points or Paragraphs on a Resume: Which is Better?\nThere\u2019s no contest. Bullet points are always better than paragraphs on a resume. They increase the amount of white space on the page and improve layout. In short, they improve readability, comprehension and user satisfaction."}
{"content": "What more could you want than a satisfied hiring manager who can easily understand why you\u2019re the best candidate?"}
{"content": "Should Resumes Have Periods After Bullet Points?\nIt\u2019s a contentious point, but the generally agreed rule is that you have to include a period if you\u2019ve written your resume bullet points as complete sentences. If they\u2019re fragments however you can leave it out. But consistency remains key, don\u2019t have some bullet points in a list with periods and some without, it\u2019ll just look messy."}

{"content": "Increased customer satisfaction by 18% (Result) by implementing a feedback system (Action) during a company-wide effort to improve service quality (Task) in response to low survey scores across the department (Situation)"}
{"content": "2. Start with action verbs\nAction verbs are words that make you come across as someone who takes initiative instead of just following instructions."}
{"content": "Starting your bullet points with action verbs like the ones below instead of passive phrases like \u201cresponsible for\u201d or \u201ctasked with\u201d will make your resume more impactful:"}
{"content": "Optimized\nLed\nDeveloped\nImplemented\nSpearheaded\nDesigned\nResolved\nCoordinated\nEnhanced\nDelivered\nRemember that the bullet points for your current job should be written in the present tense."}

{"content": "Focus on emphasizing accomplishments that show why you\u2019re a good fit for your target role and company, and omit information from other, less relevant jobs."}
{"content": "For example, if you were applying for an HR role, one of your resume bullets might look something like this:"}
{"content": "Streamlined onboarding processes, reducing employee training time by 12% and increasing team productivity\n4. Highlight keywords from the job description\nNot sure what you should include in your resume bullet points? Check the job description for clues."}
{"content": "Write down resume keywords that describe the employer\u2019s ideal candidate, such as:"}
{"content": "Personality traits\nSkills\nExperience\nCertifications\nDegrees\nOnce you have a list of keywords, incorporate those that apply to you and your background into your bullet points. This helps align your resume with the job description and make your qualifications more compelling."}
{"content": "Remember to be careful not to overuse the same keyword repeatedly, and don\u2019t copy the job description word-for-word."}
{"content": "5. Quantify your accomplishments\nWhenever possible, add specific metrics to your resume bullet points. Quantifying your achievements helps employers understand the scale of the impact you\u2019ve made through your work."}
{"content": "For example, instead of saying that you managed the sales team, mention how many team members you managed and how much sales increased under your leadership. The more specific you are, the easier it is for employers to imagine what you can contribute to their team."}
{"content": "Additionally, including hard numbers in your resume bullet points shows that you\u2019re goal-oriented and used to tracking your progress."}

{"content": "A 2018 study found that recruiters spend an average of 7.4 seconds skimming through each resume they receive. When you\u2019re applying for jobs, you only have that brief window to hook a recruiter\u2019s attention \u2014 so your resume needs to pack a punch."}
{"content": "How do you create a memorable, impactful resume that will help you get more interviews in 2024? One of the simplest and most effective strategies is to quantify your resume achievements with numbers and data. We\u2019ll break down that concept in more detail below."}
{"content": "What does it mean to quantify your resume?\nAccording to the previously-mentioned study, many hiring managers prefer to see resumes with bulleted lists of achievements in the work experience section. These bullet points should be short, bite-sized, and easily scannable for quick reading. The most memorable and effective bullet points feature examples of your past achievements quantified with specific metrics, as in the resume sample below."}
{"content": "An example of quantified bullet points you can use on your resume\nAn example of quantified bullet points you can use on your resume\nNotice how each bullet point references specific numbers (e.g. \u201creduced development costs by 25 percent\u201d) in connection with the candidate\u2019s achievements. These points are great examples of quantified achievements. The more quantified achievements you can include in your resume, the more you will stand out in a recruiter\u2019s eyes."}
{"content": "Easy ways to quantify your resume\nThere are many ways to add quantifiable metrics to the work experience bullet points of your resume. You should always choose numbers that are most relevant to your industry, whether it\u2019s the amount of revenue you generated, the costs you reduced, or the processes you streamlined for greater efficiency. Here are some of the best and easiest ways to quantify your resume:"}
{"content": "Revenue, profit, or sales generated\nIncreased (or reduced) x by y%\nTime saving\nProject or data size\nQuantity of work\nTime commitment\nRevenue, profit, or sales generated\nUltimately, any recruiter who is considering hiring you wants to know: can you add to their bottom line? Are you going to be a profitable addition to their company? Showing how you\u2019ve generated revenue, boosted sales, cut costs, or increased profit for past employers can make you a very desirable candidate."}
{"content": "Of course, this metric works best with sales and business positions that directly generate revenue \u2014 not all jobs lend themselves to being quantified in this way. But if you can measure your impact in the number of dollars you\u2019ve brought in, don\u2019t be shy about saying so."}
{"content": "You should aim to quantify most of your bullet points with numbers, metrics and data. I\u2019d recommend trying out the tool below to check if your resume has enough uses of numbers, data and quantifiable accomplishments. It's a good litmus test to figure out if you\u2019ve checked all the boxes from a hiring manager\u2019s perspective."}
{"content": "Example bullet points:"}
{"content": "Designed and executed company-wide digital marketing strategy that drove $500,000 in product sales\nOrganized a series of community fundraising events with 250+ attendees; generated $100,000 in donations\nIncreased (or reduced) x by y%\nYou can use this versatile metric for any job where you\u2019ve made a difference. If you\u2019ve been in a marketing or similar role, you could discuss how you grew your brand\u2019s readership or audience size. Or, in a customer service job, you could talk about how you achieved a reduction in customer complaints or negative online reviews. If you don\u2019t know the exact percentage of the change you achieved, it\u2019s okay to provide your best estimate."}
{"content": "You can also give examples of where you\u2019ve improved processes or working conditions. Increasing productivity, employee satisfaction, and other aspects of the workplace can be very impactful for companies, so they\u2019re valid metrics to call out in your resume."}
{"content": "Example bullet points:"}
{"content": "Led intensive customer service training for all sales staff, creating a 65% reduction in customer complaints\nProvided individualized coaching and feedback for employees on a quarterly basis, leading to a 25% increase in workplace satisfaction\nTime saving\nYou know the saying \u2013 time is money. Saving valuable company time can be as significant to the bottom line as directly saving money, which makes it an excellent thing to quantify on your resume. You can approach this on a small scale by detailing the number of hours you saved by streamlining the efficiency of your own projects, or on a larger scale by estimating the total number of man hours you saved for your company."}
{"content": "Example bullet points:"}
{"content": "Led 2 business analysts to automate repetitive process flows using Excel Macros / VBA and reduced analysis time by 10+ hours per week\nBuilt Tableau dashboard to visualize core business KPIs (e.g. Monthly Recurring Revenue), saving 10 hours per week of manual reporting work\nProject or data size\nRunning a two-person team or planning a dinner for 5 people is very different from overseeing a 500-person department or organizing an event for 200 attendees. Make the scale of your accomplishments clear to a hiring manager by including quantifiable metrics like the size of your department, event, budget, or data set."}

This doesn't need to be an exact figure, giving a range or an approximate figure is fine."}

{"content": "How to quantify your resume for different industries\nThe best quantifiable achievements to choose vary depending on your industry. For instance, in sales, annual targets and increased revenue are good to focus on, while in education, innovative teaching methods and improved student test scores would be equally impressive. Similarly, streamlined workflows are great to highlight in project management, while in healthcare, you could mention the number of patient contacts or ongoing education credits."}

{"content": "Sales: \"Revamped product presentation strategy, leading to a 25% increase in customer engagement and a 10% rise in sales.\"\nData Analysis: \"Leveraged data visualization tools to present monthly sales trends, leading to a more effective resource allocation strategy and a 10% reduction in overhead costs.\"\nMarketing: \"Initiated a social media campaign that increased web traffic by 40%, contributing to a 15% rise in online sales.\"\nEducation: \"Redesigned the curriculum for 11th-grade biology, leading to an 18% improvement in average student scores.\"\nProject Management: \"Implemented a new project tracking tool, leading to a 20% reduction in project completion times.\"\nHealthcare: \"Introduced a digital patient record system, resulting in a 30% decrease in information retrieval time.\u201d\nManufacturing: \"Implemented a Lean manufacturing technique, which reduced production time by 20% and increased overall productivity by 15%.\"\nDigital & E-commerce: \"Optimized SEO strategies to boost the website's organic traffic by 35% over six months.\u201d\nFAQs\nWhy do I need to quantify my resume?\nHiring managers don\u2019t just want to hear about your talent and abilities; they want to see proof of what you\u2019ve actually accomplished in the past. They want to know that you\u2019ve had a positive impact in your previous jobs and that you\u2019re capable of excellent work."}
{"content": "When you quantify your resume accomplishments with specific numbers, you\u2019re not just making empty claims about your skills and experience -- you\u2019re backing your claims up with evidence. Quantified achievements are far more meaningful and concrete than vague statements about what you were \u201cresponsible for\u201d at a previous job, and they can also help differentiate you from your competition."}
{"content": "What should I do if I don\u2019t have access to numbers from my previous jobs?\nWhen you\u2019re quantifying your achievements, you may not always know the exact number of dollars you brought in or the percentage of growth you created. If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t panic -- all you need to do is provide your best guess."}
{"content": "For example, if you upgraded some machinery and made your company\u2019s operations more efficient, you could estimate how many hours of labor those new machines saved per week. To take it a step further, you could multiply these weekly labor hours by the average hourly employee pay to give a rough idea of how much money the machines saved."}
{"content": "In certain jobs, such as those where you help coach, mentor, and guide other people, it may be challenging to think of tangible, measurable achievements to list on your resume. In these cases, you could focus on metrics such as the number of clients you\u2019ve served or new team members you\u2019ve hired."}
{"content": "What if I\u2019m a student or recent graduate with limited work experience?\nIf you don\u2019t have much work history yet, focus your resume on any relevant experiences you have had -- they could be courses you took in school, internships you\u2019ve held, or extracurricular projects you\u2019ve done. Recruiters know that those activities are valuable learning experiences, and they often teach you transferable job skills."}
{"content": "List these experiences on your resume as if they were jobs, and create bullet points for each one, as shown in the example below.

If you worked in sales, finance, or anything else particularly number-driven, finding ways to quantify your accomplishments should be relatively easy. But what about people who work in positions that aren't so easily quantified?"}
{"content": "Instead of adding numbers that don't relate to your core achievements just for the sake of data, try these strategies:"}
{"content": "Explain the scale of what you did. Did you tutor 12 children or organize an event with 400 attendees?\nMention the frequency of ongoing duties. Did you send a weekly newsletter, daily status reports, or reconcile a monthly budget?\nDescribe your time investment.

{"content": "Here are two great articles on ATS: Beating ATS Understanding ATS"}
{"content": "Technical Skills\nTechnical skills on a resume showcase specific knowledge and expertise in using tools, software, hardware, or specialized processes within a particular field. They demonstrate your ability to perform job-specific tasks and are crucial for many positions, especially those in technology, engineering, science, and other technical fields."}
{"content": "There are different types of technical skills, which can be broadly categorized as:"}
{"content": "Hard Technical Skills: These involve hands-on, practical knowledge of specific tools, software, hardware, or techniques. Examples include:"}
{"content": "Programming languages: Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, etc.\nSoftware applications: Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe Creative Suite, CAD software, project management software, etc.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux\nData analysis tools: SQL, R, SAS\nNetworking protocols: TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP\nCloud computing platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud\nSpecific technical processes: Machine learning, statistical analysis, web development\nSoft Technical Skills: These skills involve using technical knowledge to solve problems, analyze data, communicate effectively, and collaborate with others. Examples include:"}
{"content": "Troubleshooting: Identifying and resolving technical issues\nData analysis: Collecting, processing, and interpreting data\nProject management: Planning, organizing, and executing technical projects\nTechnical writing: Creating clear and concise technical documentation\nPresentation skills: Communicating technical information effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences\nWhen incorporating technical skills into resume bullet points, a common and effective structure to follow is the PAR (Problem-Action-Result) method:"}
{"content": "Problem (or Project): Briefly describe the challenge, project, or task you faced. This sets the context for your technical skill application.\nAction: Explain the specific actions you took to address the problem or complete the task. Highlight the technical skills you used and how you applied them.\nResult: Quantify the positive outcome or impact of your actions. Emphasize the results achieved through your technical skills, using numbers or percentages if possible.\nHere's an example of a PAR bullet point showcasing technical skills:"}
{"content": "Problem: Website traffic was declining due to slow page load times and poor user experience.\nAction: Implemented website optimization techniques, including image compression, code minification, and caching, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Improved site navigation and mobile responsiveness.\nResult: Increased website traffic by 25% within three months, decreased page load time by 50%, and improved user engagement metrics by 15%.\nThis structure effectively demonstrates your technical skills in a context that's meaningful to employers. It shows not only that you possess certain skills but also how you have successfully applied them to achieve tangible results."}
{"content": "What about soft interpersonal skills?\nWhat are soft skills? They are terms that describe character traits, such as:"}
{"content": "Problem-solving\nOutgoing communicator\nCritical thinker\nDriven\nThe problem with these terms is that they are so over-used that they have lost all value. Anybody can say that are \"driven\", but few can prove it. Accordingly, it's best to leave these skills off of your resume. They will be implied through well-written descriptions of your responsibilities and accomplishments."}
{"content": "Ideally, your bullet points will highlight quantifiable achievements as opposed to responsibilities. That means specific accomplishments with metrics to back them up. It is more effective to tell the reader how you have impacted the company and how you have added value. Instead of saying \"I have excellent communication skills,\" say \"Presented quarterly performance updates to internal stakeholders,\" in order to demonstrate it."}
{"content": "Should I evaluate my skill levels?\nUnless you hold a skill or certification that has levels prescribed through a conventional standard (i.e., such as through a governing body), it's best not to provide a self-evaluation. If you include a skill on your resume, the assumption is that you have at least a working knowledge of that skill such that you could employ it in a professional setting. If you don't meet this requirement, it's best not to include it."}
{"content": "Education\nThis section will vary greatly from individual to individual according to your level of qualification and its relevance to the jobs you are applying to. If your education is very relevant for the job you are applying to then it should be featured on the first page of your resume above your experience section."}
{"content": "Your education would normally be considered relevant if it is within the same field for which you are working. For example, a Finance Degree for an accounting role or an MBA for a Management Consultancy position. It would also be considered relevant if you're a recent graduate with limited work experience, as it shows your ability to learn and demonstrates your level of training and knowledge."}
{"content": "However, if you did not achieve a high level of education, did not study in any particular field, or you left school or university more than ten years\u2019 ago, then your experience is probably going to be much more relevant than your education. In this case, add your education section below the experience section."}
{"content": "Should I include my GPA?\nThe general rule is never if under 3.0 and always if over 3.5. If you've been out of school for a year or more and you are already working in your field, your GPA is probably not important enough to be included on your resume at all."}
{"content": "Many countries (notably the UK) do not employ the concept of a GPA, preferring rather to represent the general academic accomplishment with degree modifiers such as \"Upper Second-Class Honours\"."}
{"content": "Interests/hobbies\nMost of the time, an interests or hobbies section is not needed, simply because there are more pertinent things you could include in its place. The other reason is that most of the time, people don't include anything interesting at all or worth mentioning."}
{"content": "For example, most resume interest sections go something like this: \"Reading, running, swimming, coding, research\"."}
{"content": "Not only is this uninteresting, but it's a complete waste of space. If you're going to include this section, at the very least make it specific (i.e., reading WWII history)."}
{"content": "References\nDon't include references or \u201creferences available upon request\u201d on your resume. Do bring a reference sheet to any interviews so that you can provide them should they be requested."}
{"content": "Resume Length\nYou want to make sure your resume is only as long as it absolutely needs to be. The goal of a resume is to pique readers\u2019 interests, establish qualifications and create some curiosity that will lead to an interview. For most people, one or two pages is sufficient. There are exceptions to this:"}
{"content": "For professionals in IT, cybersecurity, software engineering, or government roles, it's not uncommon to use two to three page resumes."}
{"content": "For senior executives with an extensive career history, three page resumes are acceptable."}
{"content": "For professionals in academia, an academic cv is the standard and can range between five and twelve pages in length."}
{"content": "Submitting a resume\nHow many resumes should I send out, and how much time should I spend on each one?\nIn today's economy, it is not uncommon to send out 20 resumes before receiving a call back. Each resume should be targeted toward the industry and position to which you are applying. That will mean that you have several variants of your resume. Every cover letter should also be targeted toward the specific position AND the company."}
{"content": "You've probably heard the adage of \"Until you find a job, finding a job is your full-time job\". It is up to you and your situation how much time you can and should put in to your job search."}
{"content": "However, another crucial decision is how to balance quality and quantity. You can send out 50 identical resumes or four tailored ones. Contrary to popular advice, the answer is not always clear, and as a new grad, it can be hard to know what exactly you can change in a resume to reflect a specific job."}
{"content": "However, it is generally recommended that you produce a few variants to cover your bases in the following categories:"}
{"content": "Industry - You may be a programmer with a background in many languages, but if you are going into web applications, you don't need to outline your past C++ projects."}
{"content": "Company Size - Smaller companies may be more interested in you as a person rather than as an employee. Also, smaller companies will often skip the hiring manager and put your resume right into the hands of your prospective boss, meaning your resume can have more technical lingo."}
{"content": "Country - If you are applying internationally, it can be useful to state your work permit eligibility."}
{"content": "The most important thing is to put enough time into the resume variants and the cover letters to make sure there are no mistakes."}
{"content": "Copy-pasting can result in a Dear Sir letter forwarded to Sarah Smith or a wrong company name. That is a death sentence. As a teenager, spend 30+ minutes on an application. As a university student, 1+ hours. As a new graduate, 1-2 hours. As a specialist, 2-4 hours. Everything you put in, you will get out."}
{"content": "Sending PDF or Word Doc?\nMost ATS are compatible with both and in some job advertisements, the employer will specify which format to be used. However, some evidence suggests that a majority of ATS are more compatible with Word documents rather than PDF."}
{"content": "Note: PDF resumes created in Adobe InDesign, Overleaf LaTeX, or Canva have been shown to not do as well with a lot of applicant tracking systems (ATS). If you plan on using one of these applications to build your resume, do so at your own risk."}
{"content": "Should my cover letter just be the body of an email?\nThe body of your email is not your cover letter and if one is requested, you still need to provide it on a separate letterhead (i.e., as a stand alone document)."}
{"content": "Should the cover letter and resume be combined in one document?\nTreat the two as separate documents unless otherwise instructed in the job advertisement."}
{"content": "Building and Formatting a Resume With Little to No Work Experience\nEducation\nAs a student or recent graduate, your education section becomes the cornerstone of your resume. While experienced professionals typically place education below their work history, you'll want to lead with it. This immediately shows recruiters you're building relevant knowledge in your field."}
{"content": "Make your coursework count by being selective. Instead of listing every class you've taken, highlight 3-4 courses that directly relate to the job you're targeting. For example, if you're applying for a marketing internship, courses like Digital Marketing, Consumer Behavior, and Marketing Analytics deserve emphasis."}
{"content": "For academic projects, focus on outcomes and real-world applications:"}
{"content": "Rather than \"Completed final project in Business Strategy,\" write \"Developed comprehensive growth strategy for local business, which contributed to a 20% projected revenue increase\""}
{"content": "Instead of \"Group project in Software Engineering,\" try \"Led 4-person team to create inventory management system using Python and SQL\""}
{"content": "Remember: GPA is optional unless it's above 3.5 or specifically requested. Academic honors, dean's list appearances, and relevant scholarships all deserve mention, but keep descriptions brief and impactful."}
{"content": "Skills\nYour skills section is where classroom learning transforms into workplace capabilities. For entry-level positions, recruiters often scan this section first to see if you have the basic technical foundation they need."}
{"content": "Create clear categories for your skills to make them easily scannable. Common groupings include:"}
{"content": "Technical Skills (software, programming languages, specialized tools)\nLanguage Proficiencies (with accurate fluency levels)\nLaboratory/Research Techniques (for STEM fields)\nIndustry-Specific Tools (like design software or accounting systems)\nShould you list skill levels?"}
{"content": "You don't need to list skill levels in the skills section; instead, show how you used said skills in the work experience or projects sections."}
{"content": "Created 3 full-stack applications using React\nCompleted 5 data analysis projects using R\nDesigned marketing materials for student organizations using Adobe Creative Suite\nAvoid listing basic software like Microsoft Word unless specifically requested in the job posting. Focus instead on specialized tools and skills that differentiate you. And remember: anything you list is fair game for interview questions, so be prepared to demonstrate your capabilities."}
{"content": "Projects & Portfolio\nFor those with limited work experience, your projects section becomes your proof of capability. While experienced professionals show their work history, you'll use projects to demonstrate your ability to apply knowledge, solve problems, and deliver results."}
{"content": "Every project on your resume should tell a clear story of what you accomplished and how it made a difference. The most effective project descriptions follow a simple formula: What you built + How you built it + The impact or outcome."}
{"content": "Example: Instead of Created a website for local business Say this..."}
{"content": "Developed responsive e-commerce site using React and Node.js, resulting in 200+ online orders in first month."}
{"content": "When describing group projects, show your involvement while acknowledging teamwork. Examples:"}
{"content": "Led 3-person team in developing inventory management system, coordinating weekly sprints and client communication\nManaged front-end development within 5-person project team, delivering all components on schedule\nCoordinated with 4 team members to research and present market expansion strategy for local startup\nDocumentation matters as much as the project itself. Include links to:"}
{"content": "GitHub repositories with clean, well-commented code\nLive websites or applications\nProject documentation and technical write-ups\nResearch posters or presentations\nProcess blogs or case studies\nSelecting which projects to include requires strategy. Prioritize:"}
{"content": "Projects that align with your target industry or role\nWork that demonstrates relevant skills\nProjects with measurable outcomes or impact\nCollaborative work that shows your ability to work within a team\nSelf-directed projects that show your ability to work independently\nFor technical roles, include project details:"}
{"content": "Technologies and languages used\nScale and complexity (users, data volume, features)\nTechnical challenges overcome\nPerformance improvements achieved\nRemember: Quality beats quantity. Three well-described, relevant projects are more valuable than a long list of minor assignments. Each project should earn its place on your resume by clearly demonstrating skills relevant to your target role."}
{"content": "Experience Alternatives\nWhen traditional work experience is limited, your challenge is to show other activities that demonstrate professional capabilities. The important thing is presenting these experiences in a way that highlights transferable skills and measurable impact."}

{"content": "Quantifying your performance on a resume is an effective way to demonstrate your value and highlight your accomplishments in prior positions. In a competitive job market, it is important to make sure that you are giving yourself every available advantage. A resume with quantified accomplishments leaves a strong impression on the hiring professional who reads it. In this article, we discuss how to effectively quantify accomplishments on a resume, the benefits of doing so and examples that compare quantified and unquantified resumes.\nWhy is it important to know how to quantify on a resume?\nA strong resume with an effective cover letter is an essential part of applying for a competitive job listing. One of the best ways to make your resume more memorable and effective is to include specific numbers when listing your accomplishment or prior experience, as opposed to describing them using vague terms. When you quantify your resume, you read through it to identify areas where you can use more precise numbers that offer a clearer representation of the value that you provide.\nRead more: 4 Examples of Key Performance Metrics to Track\nThe benefits of quantifying your accomplishments on a resume\nAdding numbers into your resume is one of the simplest and most effective ways to make it more memorable and impressive. Reasons to include precise quantities whenever possible include:\nQuantifying your performance provides specificity for the hiring professional who is reading your resume. A phrase such as \"significantly increased new client acquisition\" can mean a broad range of performance results to a broad range of readers, whereas a direct quantity such as \"oversaw a 37% growth in new client acquisition\" states precisely how effective your work was.\nProviding numbers makes your claims on the resume more credible. Using precise quantities implies that you have the data to back up your claims, which means that you are not embellishing.\nUsing quantities on your resume demonstrates that you are results-oriented. Rather than focusing on abstract concepts, presenting the bottom-line results of your prior experience allows those results to represent your priorities and performance.\nNumbers help your resume to stick in the mind of the hiring professional. Often for competitive positions, there will be several rounds of assessment in which the field of potential hires is narrowed down. Specific quantities separate your resume from comparable applicants', improving your chances of being moved on to the next phase of the hiring process.\nRead more: How to Write Strong Bullet Points for Your Resume\nHow to quantify accomplishments on a resume\nWhen you quantify your resume, you should make sure that you use numbers as effectively as possible by following these steps:\n1. Track your work\nThe more data you have on your performance at prior jobs, the better situated you will be to identify the metrics that present you in as favorable a light as possible. While it is possible to organize your data after the fact when you are searching for new work, the best way to prepare yourself is to keep your performance data updated as you go.\nMake a habit of tracking some of the most important metrics of your job performance. Not only does this make it so that you do not have to spend valuable job search time compiling all of your old data, but it also helps you perform better by allowing you to see where you are excelling and where your performance could be improved. It's an effective way to determine if any changes you have implemented are having the desired results.\n2. Gather your data\nIf you haven't kept records of your performance data prior to starting work on your resume for a job search or promotion application, that doesn't mean you can't still use quantities to improve your resume.\nIf you find that you have a lack of usable data and need to gather all of your data during the job search, you may need to prioritize which metrics you devote time to compiling data on. Think about both the areas that will be most applicable to the position you are applying for and the metrics where you performed the best and start by compiling the information you need to quantify them, then proceed to other areas as time permits.\n3. Make use of ranges\nWhile specificity is valuable on a resume, sometimes you won't always have access to precise numbers. Whether the lack of precision is because you do not have the data you need to give an exact number or because there was variance in the underlying data, a range is an effective way to communicate the data without being overly specific. For example, a personal trainer may describe their work at a prior gym by saying they served 15 to 20 clients every week in order to give an impression of their client load while acknowledging it could vary from week to week.\n4. Focus on key metrics\nProviding numbers helps to make your claims less ambiguous, but they are most effective when used to focus on key metrics that appeal to hiring professionals, such as:\nMoney: Financial numbers are essential for any successful company, and that means they are always a valuable addition on your resume. If you can demonstrate improved financial performance, such as citing an increase in sales or net profits, you should do so by including the specific dollar amount you have generated.\nPeople: Depending on the position you are applying for, you can quantify everything from the number of clients you had to the size of the staff working under you.\nTime: Experience is highly valued in the professional world, so you should always use specific numbers when possible to demonstrate the length of your professional experience.\nRankings: Many industries make use of ranks, and you should include them in your resume if possible. For example, a search engine optimization professional could include that they helped improve a client from the fourth page of search results to the top-ranking position for targeted keywords.\n5. Double-check your work\nWhen including quantities on your resume, double-check that they are correct before you send your resume out to employers. It's important to present the most accurate information possible to remain honest during the hiring process.\nExamples of quantifying resume accomplishments\nUsing numbers on your resume is an effective technique across a broad range of industries and careers. These examples can help show you how to quantify a resume no matter what your chosen career is:\nExample 1: Education\nUnquantified: Helped students to improve their standardized testing scores in order to raise their college application prospects.\nQuantified: Developed and implemented an AP Calculus curriculum that resulted in a 4.3 average on AP testing and a 92% success rate.\nExample 2: Human resources\nUnquantified: Coordinated payroll, benefits and conflict resolution for a large staff while maintaining high company morale.\nQuantified: Oversaw human resources staff of seven employees serving an office of 450 staff members, maintaining strong staff relationships to aid in retention and production.\nExample 3: Management\nUnquantified: Created policies to improve staff performance across all divisions, resulting in increased profits from year to year.\nQuantified: Led a staff of 20 employees with innovative policies that yielded a 27% increase in profits from the previous calendar year.\nExample 4: Marketing professional\nUnquantified: Developed an online marketing platform to improve organic search traffic results and increase client acquisition numbers.\nQuantified: Developed an innovative online marketing platform that produced top-three results on all targeted keywords, yielding a 48% increase in organic search traffic and $17,000 of increased sales.\nExample 5: Sales associate\nUnquantified: Created bonds with clients to develop lasting relationships, resulting in significant sales performances in every quarter.\nQuantified: Developed strong bonds with clients resulting in long-lasting relationships and the title of #1 Sales Associate in the Northeast and #3 Sales Associate Nationwide."}

{"content": "Formatting your resume as a pdf. This seems like a no-brainer in 2019, but Google\u2019s guides repeat this advice several times, so we have to assume not everyone does this automatically."}
{"content": "Skipping\u00a0the objective. (They know what your objective is: to land this particular job.)"}
{"content": "Using\u00a0black text, and keep the font and size clean, simple, and consistent."}
{"content": "Checking for typos. This is so important, we\u2019ll say it again: Check for typos."}
{"content": "Using\u00a0bullet points. (How\u2019s this for meta advice, since you\u2019re reading it in a bullet point?)\u00a0Don\u2019t include long lines of descriptive text. Put yourself in the place of a human resume-reviewer, who is likely reading dozens of resumes at a time."}
{"content": "Making\u00a0sure you include your contact info. Yes, this seems obvious \u2014 but make sure your name and email address are prominent. If you\u2019re applying for technical positions, include your Github link (more on that below)."}
{"content": "2. Customization"}
{"content": "You should write a new, tailored resume for every position you apply for. Also, the Google recruiters advise keeping it\u00a0under a single page."}
{"content": "The\u00a0exception to this is that if you are applying for a technical or engineering position, you can legitimately have a large number of relevant projects to list, and that might take you to a second page."}
{"content": "But for almost any other type of position, one page is the rule."}
{"content": "This also means that you have to be a ruthless editor. If you have tons of relative experience, you\u2019ll want to describe it all\u00a0as succinctly as possible, while still getting your message across."}
{"content": "One specific piece of advice is that if any bullet point on your resume spills over by a word or two into a second line, figure out a way to write it shorter, so it stays on one line. Space is at a premium with a suggested one-page maximum."}
{"content": "3. Use the X by Y by Z formula"}
{"content": "This is the crux of the advice by Laszlo Bock, a former Google senior vice president of personnel operations. You want to adhere to the bullet-point format as we\u2019ve discussed, and articulate your experience in this specific way."}
{"content": "Google describes this as: \u201cAccomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].\u201d But just to make it easier to remember, let\u2019s shorten it to X-Y-Z."}
{"content": "This means that you want to focus on accomplishments \u2014 quantitative results and the impact that you had as a result. It\u2019s probably easiest to explain this by using a few examples from the Google recruiters\u2019 YouTube videos themselves."}
{"content": "For example, imagine an applicant who wants to make clear that he or she is a member of a prestigious group. Here\u2019s the OK way, the better way, and the best way to describe this on a resume, according to Google:"}
{"content": "OK: \u201cMember of Leadership for Tomorrow Society\u201d"}
{"content": "Better: \u201cSelected as one of 275 for this 12-month professional development program for high-achieving diverse talent.\u201d"}
{"content": "Best: \u201cSelected as one of 275 participants nationwide for this 12-month professional development program for high-achieving diverse talent based\u00a0on leadership potential and academic success.\u201d"}
{"content": "Here\u2019s another example, this one for a technical position in which the applicant wants to point out that he or she placed second in a hackathon."}
{"content": "OK: \u201cWon second place in hackathon.\u201d Better: \u201cWon second place out of 50 teams in hackathon.\u201d"}
{"content": "Best: \u201cWon second place out of 50 teams in hackathon at NJ Tech by working with two colleagues to develop an app that synchronizes mobile calendars."}
{"content": "(In this case, the last, \u201cbest\u201d is my own interpretation; Google doesn\u2019t actually provide the third suggestion. But I hope the point is clear.)"}
{"content": "Here\u2019s a final example, intended for a business applicant who wants to show how much he or she contributed in a client support role:"}
{"content": "OK: \u201cGrew revenue for small and medium business clients.\u201d"}
{"content": "Better: \u201cGrew revenue for small and medium business clients by 10% QoQ\u201d"}
{"content": "Best:\u00a0\u201cGrew revenue for 15 small and medium business clients by 10% QoQ by mapping new software features as solutions to their business goals.\u201d"}
{"content": "One point about jargon: Use shorthand like \u201cQoQ\u201d (for quarter over quarter) only if you\u2019re 100 percent sure that the resume reviewer will know exactly what you mean."}
{"content": "4. Advanced formatting"}
{"content": "Beyond the basic formatting issues, like keeping it to one page and using bullet points, there are some slightly more advanced formatting issues to consider."}
{"content": "You want to be sure to organize things in the same way that recruiters and reviewers are used to seeing them. The rules include:"}
{"content": "education before experience if you\u2019re a student or a relatively recent graduate, or"}
{"content": "experience before education (in reverse chronological order), if you\u2019ve been in the workforce for more than a position or two."}
{"content": "For recent graduates, Google insists on school, degree, major, GPA, and month and year of graduation. But the further away you are from college, the less college and university information you\u2019re expected to include."}
{"content": "\u201cGenerally the more recently you attended university, the more detail you should include here,\u201d Google technical recruiter Jeremy Ong says in one of the videos."}
{"content": "The one caveat here, and frankly it\u2019s not something that Google addresses, is how to handle year of graduation if you\u2019re an older applicant."}
{"content": "There\u2019s a point at which Google probably doesn\u2019t want to know your age, so as to reduce the odds of ever having to defend against an age discrimination claim. Obviously putting on your resume that you graduated from college in 1990 suggests you\u2019re well\u00a0over 40."}
{"content": "Beyond that, however, focus on things that are most relevant for the position, and don\u2019t be afraid to cut older positions and achievements, especially if they\u2019re not relevant."}
{"content": "If you have a lengthy work history that would push you beyond the one-page suggested maximum length, you might add\u00a0a short, additional section mentioning that you have other, less relevant experience, without going into great detail."}
{"content": "5. For technical applicants"}
{"content": "If you\u2019re applying for technical or engineering jobs, there are a couple of additional pieces of advice."}
{"content": "The first is to include your Github link, or equivalent, at the top with your contact information. (Ironic,\u00a0since Microsoft has owned Github since last year.)"}
{"content": "Additionally, the recruiters want to see your programming languages listed prominently. And as you list projects and experience \u2014 either in a separate section or as part of your employment history \u2014 include programming languages you used for each project."}
{"content": "Obviously, this is all for step one in the recruiting process \u2014 the resume and application \u2014 and Google has other videos on later-stage items like how to prepare for specific types of interviews."}
{"content": "But even as someone who isn\u2019t likely to apply for a job with Google or any other company anytime soon, I found it helpful in terms of the information to ask for when recruiting and interviewing."}

You need to show that you have done your research and you understand the company mission and how you will contribute towards that goal."}

I worked closely with the Chief Strategy Officer and the Head of External Developer Relations to identify potential publishing and M&A opportunities. During my watch we closed two strategic deals that are now contributing with more than 10% of the portfolio revenue. After that incredible experience, I was invited to join a start-smaller SaaS mobile data company called\u00a0[SAAS COMPANY].

{"content": "Past-tense power verb bullet points:\u00a0This is the standard for all resume language, not just software engineer resumes. Diversify your verbs and make sure they are past-tense if you\u2019re no longer at that company. Only use the present tense if you\u2019re currently working at that company and in that role."}
{"content": "Grammar and spelling errors:\u00a0Triple-check that you don\u2019t have any."}

{"content": "How to Write Resume Bullets That Get Interviews\nWriting your resume? Here's how to write effective bullet points that convince an employer to invite you for an interview. Plus, get access to over 300 pre-written sample bullet points that you can use when writing your own resume.\nRecruiters don't read your resume. Instead, they skim through it."}
{"content": "That's why recruiters and hiring managers advise you use short, succinct bullet points, instead of long, wordy paragraphs to describe your achievements. Bullet points make your resume easy to skim and help hiring managers quickly get a sense of your previous achievements."}
{"content": "A framework to write effective resume bullet points\nSo what makes an effective resume bullet point? Well, the key is that each bullet point needs to demonstrate impact and highlight your experience in an effective way. To make it easy for you, here's a specific framework you can use as a checklist when writing each of your bullet points:"}
{"content": "Start your bullet point with a strong Action Verb (e.g. Created, Managed, Spearheaded, etc).\nAccomplishments, not responsibilities. Remember, your bullet points should always tell the recruiter or hiring manager what you accomplished, and not what you do on a day to day basis. \nIf you find yourself starting your bullet point with 'Responsible for', you're likely writing about your responsibilities and not your accomplishments.  \nAvoid using weak verbs like 'Assisted' or 'Helped'. These verbs don't clearly communicate your role in your achievement, and aren't specific enough in telling recruiters what you actually did. If you 'assisted' with something, you could have for example led the project or just participated in meetings. Of course, the latter is far less impactful.\nSimilarly, if you use the present tense, there's a pretty good chance you've just listed a responsibility - it's hard for something you have accomplished to be written in the present tense (e.g. use 'Managed', not 'Manage' nor 'Managing').\nQuantify your impact using numbers and metrics. Did your achievement save time for your team? Increase revenue? While you might not be able to do this for every bullet point, do it where you can.\nDon't use fillers (e.g. 'various', 'multiple'). Instead, be specific by using numbers (e.g. Don't say you 'implemented various features'. Instead, say you 'implemented 10+ features').\nRemove personal pronouns (e.g. I, my, their). It is understood that your resume is written about you and your experiences, and personal pronouns just take up space and increase wordiness.\n1-2 lines long. Short, succinct bullet points are key to your resume's readability. Blobs of text, that is bullets or paragraphs that are three lines or longer, are likely to not be read.\nExamples of resume bullet points\nUsing the above framework, let's go through a few examples of writing an actual bullet point that you can use on your resume. The first step is to think of a specific task or achievement from your previous role. If it's your first time writing your resume, start by writing down every fairly significant task you completed at your job."}
{"content": "Once you have that, let's add our action verbs and metrics, while also keeping in mind the rules we described above. Here's an example:"}
{"content": "Here's another example where we start with the impact we had. In this case, we describe how we reduced customer support calls."}
{"content": "Sample bullet points from top resumes\nIt's never easy writing your resume's bullet points, so use these examples to help you! If you find these samples useful, you should upgrade to Pro - you'll get access to 300+ bullet points from successful job seekers who got interviews at top-tier companies. You'll be able to a line similar to your own experience, tweak it and use it in your resume."}
{"content": "Created a performance reporting template, achieving an 80% reduction in the preparation time of standard client materials\nLed full redesign of website with findings from customer segmentation and competitive research, increasing website leads by 200%\nAnalyzed data from 25000 monthly active users and used outputs to guide marketing and product strategies; increased average app engagement time by 2x, 30% decrease in drop off rate, and 3x shares on social media\nLaunched Miami office with lead Director and recruited and managed new team of 10 employees. Grew office revenue by 200% in first nine months (representing 20% of company revenue)\nOrganized and advertised quarterly networking events with 500+ participants in six cities across California\nPromoted within 12 months due to strong performance and organizational impact - ahead of schedule by 12 months\nLed the transition to a paperless practice by implementing an electronic booking system and a faster, safer and more accurate business system; reduced cost of labor by 30% and office overhead by 10%\nNotice how each example uses the 6-point framework above. Pay close attention to the fact that all of them start with strong action verbs, use numbers and are accomplishment-oriented. These elements show your future employer what kind of impact you can have."}
{"content": "FAQs\nWhat are good bullet points for a resume?\nGood resume bullet points contain an action verb, are specific in describing your project/task and contain numbers to describe impact. A good litmus test is if a bullet point sounds like it could fit on a job description, it probably isn\u2019t a good fit for your resume."}
